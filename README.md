# Comparing-SVM-and-MLP
A detailed journey through my process of building Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine models and comparing the accuracies of those models for classifying either malignant or benign cancer readings on a Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset in Python.

After comparing the general models, I further evaluated and explained the performance of the SVM with K-fold cross validation, where k = 5.

This project was given to me as a project in my Principles of Machine Learning class.
